# Advanced Programming

> *Code isn't documented very well (sry)*

This is a repo for my practical/lab classes for my fifth semester. These mainly include topics like Exceptions, Exception Handling, File Handling, and maybe a little bit of JavaFX. 

## but why?

- I switch devices and operating systems (a lot).
